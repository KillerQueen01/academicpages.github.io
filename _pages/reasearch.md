Digital Test Template Libraries for the Rotors in Ultrasonic Lamb Wave Imaging Logging Tools
Key member, Dec. 2017 to Jan. 2019
======
* Model different versions of multiple rotor components in SolidWorks
* Pre-process the rotational balance simulation of the rotor in a fluid-filled well and the air in Abaqus/CAE considering Fluid-Structure Interaction, and conduct explicit dynamic analysis in Abaqus/Explicit based on the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithm
* Write Python scripts in correspondence with the procedures in Abaqus/CAE to build up template libraries of sizes, materials, components, and versions, and introduce user-defined parameters
* Design the Graphical User Interface of the Human-Computer Interaction platform using PyQt5

A Small Executable Program Calculating Properties of Plane Areas
Independent developer, Mar. 2017 to July 2017
======
* Explored Ear Clipping as an algorithm for triangulation of simple polygons
* Constructed the basic framework of the MATLAB Graphical User Interface and organized its underlying logic between different parts, then integrated the above into an executable program
* Applied the knowledge from the course Mechanics of Materials I into practice in MATLAB coding
* Awarded the third prize in 2017 Harbin Institute of Technology Software Development Competition on Mechanics of Materials as its innovative, versatile, and user-orientated features
  <!-- * Supervisor: Professor Git -->

A Wheel-Legged Lunar Rover for Varied Environmental Conditions
Key member,  Dec. 2015 to July 2016
======
* Devised the wheel-legged structure of the lunar rover, achieved considerable space usage rate, and maintained non-intervention between the wheels and legs
* Designed the bionic gaits based on six-legged insects, and managed locomotion by Arduino such as forward, backward, and cross movement and rotation
